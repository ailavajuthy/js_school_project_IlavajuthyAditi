# Timeline App

## Task 2: Responsive Layout with CSS

This is the second stage of the **Timeline App** project. It builds upon the basic HTML skeleton to implement a fully responsive and visually polished layout. It includes the following features:

- **Responsive Timeline**: Uses Flexbox or CSS Grid depending on the viewport size.
- **Styled Header**: Includes typography, colour scheme, and layout adjustments.
- **Styled Placeholder Event Markers**: Placeholder styles for dots/labels.
- **Modal Base Styles**: Hidden by default.
- **Adaptive Design**: Breakpoints for mobile (<768px), tablet (768–1023px), and desktop (≥1024px).
