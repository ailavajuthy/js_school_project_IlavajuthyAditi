# Timeline App

## Task 1: Static Skeleton with HTML

This is the first stage of the Timeline App. It uses basic HTML to create a static skeleton that will support future features such as timelines, theme toggling, and modals. It includes the following elements:

- A `<header>` element with a logo and theme toggle button  
- An empty `<nav>` element for future filters/placeholders  
- A `<section id="timeline">` element in which event markers will be added later on  
- An empty `<div id="modal">` which will be used for pop-ups later on  
- Basic semantic tags like `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<figure>`  

##Task 2: Responsive Layout with CSS
This is the second stage of the Timeline App project. It builds upon the basic HTML skeleton to implement a fully responsive and visually polished layout. It includes the following features:

- Responsive Timeline: Uses Flexbox or CSS Grid depending on the viewport size.
- Styled Header: Includes typography, colour scheme, and layout adjustments.
- Styled Placeholder Event Markers: Placeholder styles for dots/labels.
- Modal Base Styles: Hidden by default.
- Adaptive Design: Breakpoints for mobile (<768px), tablet (768–1023px), and desktop (≥1024px).
