# Timeline App

## Stage 1: Static Skeleton with HTML

This is the first stage of the Timeline App. It uses basic HTML to create a static skeleton that will support future features such as timelines, theme toggling, and modals. It includes the following elements:

- A `<header>` element with a logo and theme toggle button  
- An empty `<nav>` element for future filters/placeholders  
- A `<section id="timeline">` element in which event markers will be added later on  
- An empty `<div id="modal">` which will be used for pop-ups later on  
- Basic semantic tags like `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<figure>`
